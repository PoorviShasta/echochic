        <h2>We are now ‘Plastic Waste Neutral’</h2>
        <p class="para2">Within our operations, we strive to grow responsibly and continuously improve our efficiency while reducing our carbon footprint.
             This year, we achieved ‘plastic waste neutrality’, as we collected, processed, and recycled over 19,000 MT post-consumer plastic packaging waste from across the country. In the last 5 years, we have reduced usage of plastic packaging material by more than 5000 MT.
             We remain committed to help reduce the flow of plastic by continuing to make changes and bringing long-term solutions.</p>
